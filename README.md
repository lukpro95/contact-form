# contact-form
Tech service form

This is my take on the task to make an HTML Contact Form with at least 3 different field types.
The form allows users to submit the fields and send the submission in an email - if they pass the validation.

I have made validation on both Front-end and Back-end codes to prevent users from any malicious inputs and workarounds.

The website is hosted at: https://tech-service-contact.herokuapp.com/

This is the repository with the code I used to make the website.

I hope you'll like it :)
